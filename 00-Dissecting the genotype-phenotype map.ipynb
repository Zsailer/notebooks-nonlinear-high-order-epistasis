This map represents all sequences as nodes in a network and edges are drawn between sequences that differ by a single substitution. We can dissect this space and ask how individual mutations affect the functional properties of a sequence. "

Create a reliable tool (i.e. empirically informed) that can fill regions of the map that our measurements miss. This work started under this motivation. We wanted to use these models to reconstruct/infer gaps in our experiment datasets. "
