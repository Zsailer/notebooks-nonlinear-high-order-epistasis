**Fig2: Nonlinearity in phenotype creates spurious high-order epistatic coefficients.** A) Simulated, random, first-order epistatic coefficients. The mutated site is indicated by panel below the bar graph; bar indicates magnitude and sign of the epistatic coefficient. B) A nonlinear map between a linear phenotype and a saturating, nonlinear phenotype. The first-order coefficients in panel A are used to generate a linear phenotype, which is then transformed by the function shown in B. C) Epistatic coefficients extracted from the genotype-phenotype map generated in panels A and B. Bars denote coefficient magnitude and sign. Color denotes the order of the coefficient: first (βi, red), second (βij, orange), third (βijk, green), fourth (βijkl, purple), and fifth (βijklm, blue). Filled squares in the grid below the bars indicate the identity of mutations that contribute to the coefficient.
