**Fig 4: Experimental genotype-phenotype maps exhibit nonlinear phenotypes.** Plots show observed phenotype Pobs plotted against Pˆadd (Eq. 1) for data sets I through IV. Points are individual genotypes. Error bars are experimental standard deviations in phenotype. Red lines are the fit of the power transform to the data set. Pearson’s coefficient for each fit are shown on each plot. Dashed lines are Padd = Pobs. Bottom panels in each plot show residuals between the observed phenotypes and the red fit line. Points are the individual residuals. Errorbars are the experimental standard deviation of the phenotype. The horizontal histograms show the distribution of residuals across 10 bins. The red lines are the mean of the residuals.
