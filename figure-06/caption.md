**Fig 6: Nonlinear phenotypes distort measured epistatic coefficients.** Sub-panels show correlation plots between epistatic coefficients extracted without accounting for nonlinearity (x-axis) and accounting for linearity (y-axis) for data sets I-IV. Each point is an epistatic coefficient, colored by order. Error bars are standard deviations from bootstrap replicates of each fitting approach.
