**Fig 1: Genotypic epistasis can be quantified using Walsh polynomials.** A) A genotype-phenotype map exhibiting negative epistasis. Axes are genotype at position 1 (g1), genotype at position 2 (g2), and phenotype (P). For genotypic axes, “0” denotes wildtype and “1” denotes a mutant. Phenotype is encoded both on the P-axis and as a spectrum from white to blue. The map exhibits negative epistasis: relative to wildtype, the effect of the mutations together (P11 = 2) is less than the sum of the individual effects of mutations (P10 + P01 = 1 + 2 = 3). B) The map can be decomposed into epistatic coefficients using a Walsh polynomial, which measures the effects of each mutation relative to the geometric center of the genotype-phenotype map (green sphere). The additive coefficients β1 and β2 (red arrows) are the average effect of each mutation in all backgrounds. The epistatic coefficient β12 (orange arrow) the variation not accounted for by β1 and β2. Geometrically, it is the distance between the center of the map and the “fold” given by vector connecting P00 and P11.
