**Fig3: Genotypic epistasis and nonlinear scale induce different patterns of nonadditivity.** A) Patterns of nonadditivity for increasing genotypic epistasis and nonlinear scale. Main panel shows grid ranging from no epistasis (bottom left) to high genotypic epistasis and nonlinearity (top right). Insets in sub-panels show added nonlinearity. Going from left to right: K = 0, K = 2, 421 K = 4. Epistatic coefficient plots to right show magnitude of input genotypic epistasis, with colors and annotation as in Fig 2C. B) Plot of Pobs against Pˆadd for the middle sub panel in panel A. Red line is the fit of the power transform to these data. C) Correlation between epistatic coefficients input into the simulation and extracted from the simulation after correction for nonlinearity with the power transform. Each point is an epistatic coefficient, colored by order. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is shown in the upper-left quadrant. D) Correlation between epistatic coefficients input into the simulation and extracted from the simulation without application of the power transform.
