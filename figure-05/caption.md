**Fig 5: High-order epistasis is present in genotype-phenotype maps.** A) Panels show epistatic coefficients extracted from data sets I-IV (Table 1, data set label circled above each graph). Bars denote coefficient magnitude and sign; error bars are propagated measurement uncertainty. Color denotes the order of the coefficient: first (βi, red), second (βij, orange), third (βijk, green), fourth (βijkl, purple), and fifth (βijklm, blue). Bars are colored if the coefficient is significantly different than zero (Z-score with p-value < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). Stars denote relative significance: p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (* *), p < 0.001 (* * *). Filled squares in 446 the grid below the bars indicate the identity of mutations that contribute to the coefficient. The 447 names of the mutations, taken from the original publications, are indicated to the left of the grid squares. B) Sub-panels show fraction of variation accounted for by first through fifth order epistatic coefficients for data sets I-IV (colors as in panel A). Fraction described by each order is proportional to area.
